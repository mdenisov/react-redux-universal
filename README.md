Getting Started
---------------

Just clone the repo and install the necessary node modules:

```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/bystrobank/react-redux-universal.git
$ cd react-redux-universal
$ npm install                   # Install Node modules listed in ./package.json (may take a while the first time)
$ npm start                     # Compile and launch
```

Usage
-----

Before delving into the descriptions for each available npm script, here's a brief summary of the three which will most likely be your bread and butter:

* Doing live development with HMR (hot module reload)?
  * Use `npm start`(`npm run watch`) to spin up the koa and webpack-dev-server (HMR) with redux-devtools.
  * Use `npm run watch:logger` to spin up the koa and webpack-dev-server (HMR) with redux-logger.
* Doing live development without HMR? Use `npm run dev` to spin up the only koa server in watch mode.
* Compiling the application to disk? Use `npm run compile`.

Great, now that introductions have been made here's everything in full detail:

* `npm start`(`npm run watch`) - Spins up koa server to serve your app at `localhost:4000` and webpack-dev-server (HMR) at `localhost:3000`.
* `npm run compile` - Compiles the application to disk (`~/dist/server` and `~/public/client` by default).
* `npm run watch:logger` - Same as `npm start`, but uses redux-logger instead redux-devtools.
* `npm run dev` - Spins up the only koa server to serve your app at `localhost:4000`.
* `npm run lint` - Runs ESLint against your source code.

**NOTE:** Koa host and port defined by env variables `NODE_HOST` and `NODE_PORT` in `package.json`. `webpack-dev-server` is launched on the same host as koa.
Project path defined by env variable 'PROJECT_PATH' and empty by default (http://localhost:4000/PROJECT_PATH/root_route/...).

Structure
---------

The folder structure provided is only meant to serve as a guide, it is by no means prescriptive. It is something that has worked very well for me and my team, but use only what makes sense to you.

Using Redux DevTools
---------
[Redux Devtools](https://github.com/gaearon/redux-devtools) are enabled by default in `npm start`(`npm run watch`) mode.

- <kbd>CTRL</kbd>+<kbd>H</kbd> Toggle DevTools Dock
- <kbd>CTRL</kbd>+<kbd>Q</kbd> Move DevTools Dock Position
- see [redux-devtools-dock-monitor](https://github.com/gaearon/redux-devtools-dock-monitor) for more detailed information.

If you have the
[Redux DevTools chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/redux-devtools/lmhkpmbekcpmknklioeibfkpmmfibljd) installed it will automatically be used on the client-side instead.

If you want to disable the dev tools use `npm run watch:logger` or `npm run dev` mode.
DevTools are not enabled during production.
